      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Ethereum front anchors</h2>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        OCC does not require a blockchain to operate, but it uses Ethereum as
        an external write-once timeline. The same TEE that signs user proofs
        also periodically commits its current counter chain into an Ethereum
        block. The on-chain payload contains the enclave&apos;s public key, the
        epoch identifier, the current counter, and the latest proof hash —
        nothing about any individual user or file.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Each anchor is itself an OCC proof signed by the enclave, so it
        participates in the same counter chain as the user proofs that came
        before it. When the anchor lands in a finalized Ethereum block, that
        block&apos;s timestamp and ordering become an external witness to the
        position the chain had reached. Every proof committed before the
        anchor is then sealed against retroactive rewrite: any attempt to
        produce an earlier proof under that key would have to also produce a
        consistent chain that contradicts a value already written to a public
        block.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This is the mechanism behind the phrase &quot;everything before me already
        existed.&quot; An anchor seals backward, not forward. It does not prove
        when individual proofs were created, only that they preceded the
        anchor block. Combined with per-epoch keypairs, anchors give OCC a
        bounded breach window: between one anchor and the next, a compromise
        could in theory rewrite the live chain, but anything before the most
        recent anchor is already fixed in the public Ethereum timeline.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Anchors are public, but they reveal no user-identifying information.
        A verifier can fetch any anchor from Ethereum and use it to bound
        when a proof must have existed by, without ever contacting OCC.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Epoch isolation: blast-radius containment</h2>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        OCC&apos;s strongest containment property is structural, not behavioral.
        Each restart of the enclave generates a new Ed25519 keypair inside the
        boundary, derives a new <code className="text-xs font-mono bg-[#f3f4f6] px-1.5 py-0.5">epochId</code> from
        fresh hardware entropy, and resets the monotonic counter. This means
        every epoch is a sealed compartment, identified by a key that exists
        nowhere else in the world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The consequence: a compromise can only forge proofs that carry the
        live epoch&apos;s public key. It cannot retroactively produce valid proofs
        under any prior epoch&apos;s key, because that key was destroyed when its
        enclave terminated and never existed outside the boundary in the first
        place. Past proofs remain verifiable because their signatures bind to
        a public key that no surviving system can sign with.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Ethereum anchors tighten this further. Each epoch&apos;s counter chain is
        periodically sealed into an Ethereum block by the same TEE. Once an
        anchor is mined, every proof committed before that anchor is fixed in
        a public, immutable timeline that the TEE cannot rewrite even if it
        were later compromised. A breach window is therefore bounded on one
        side by the epoch boundary and on the other side by the most recent
        Ethereum anchor that preceded it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Restarting the TEE is not just operational hygiene — it is a deliberate
        containment action. Each restart closes one compartment and opens a
        fresh one, so any undetected compromise is quarantined to the bounded
        window of a single epoch. Verifiers can refuse to accept proofs from
        any epoch they have not pinned, narrowing trust to known-good
        compartments only.
