          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Trusted Execution Environments (Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, AMD SEV, RISC-V Keystone)
            and remote attestation protocols (DICE, RATS/RFC 9334) provide hardware-enforced
            isolation and cryptographic proof that specific code executed in a measured environment.
            These mechanisms establish that a particular software image ran on genuine hardware and
            that its outputs were produced by attested code.

          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            These systems answer the question: <em>&ldquo;Did specific trusted code execute?&rdquo;</em>{" "}
            OCC asks a different question: <em>&ldquo;Is authenticated durable state reachable only
            through enforced commit paths?&rdquo;</em> Attestation authenticates a pipeline. OCC
            constrains the commit architecture so that alternative pipelines cannot produce
            authenticated state. TEEs are one possible implementation substrate for OCC boundaries,
            but attestation alone does not close unprotected commit paths that exist alongside the
            attested process.

          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and related provenance
            standards define how to represent claims about an artifact&apos;s origin, edits, and
            attribution, and how to transport that information across tools and platforms. When a
            signed artifact is present, these standards make integrity and lineage verifiable and
            interoperable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            OCC targets a different architectural layer. Provenance standards are a{" "}
            <em>packaging and disclosure layer</em>: they define what claims look like and how to
            verify them. OCC is an <em>enforcement layer</em>: it determines whether authenticated
            durable state can be finalized at all unless creation-time conditions were met. The
            distinction matters because provenance ecosystems are voluntary at the edges. A signed
            artifact can be verified, but an unsigned artifact can still be created, circulated, and
            injected into downstream systems that do not strictly require provenance at every
            boundary. Provenance improves traceability without guaranteeing exclusion.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            OCC and provenance are complementary. OCC strengthens provenance by making provenance
            verifiability a prerequisite for admission into protected domains. Provenance remains the
            interoperability layer that carries claims across ecosystems; OCC supplies the mechanism
            by which systems enforce that only authenticated artifacts become trusted durable state.
            Under OCC with reference-based verification, provenance survives even when manifests are
            stripped during distribution (see the provenance example in{" "}

          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The classical reference monitor concept (Anderson, 1972) mediates all operations on
            existing objects: every access is checked against a policy before it is permitted. Origin
            Controlled Computing is strictly stronger in one dimension: it controls not merely which{" "}
            <em>operations</em> on objects are permitted, but which{" "}
            <em>objects are permitted to exist</em> in authenticated form. Classical access control
            assumes object creation is uncontrolled and focuses on subsequent access. OCC constrains
            creation itself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-2">
            Formally, a reference monitor enforces:

          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The key difference: a reference monitor assumes objects exist and mediates access. A

            applied to object generation rather than object access.

            Object-capability models (Dennis &amp; Van Horn, 1966; Miller, 2006) enforce that access

            Mandatory information flow control (Goguen &amp; Meseguer, 1982; Myers &amp; Liskov,

            distinct property: it constrains how authenticated state is <em>generated</em>, not how
            information flows between existing states. In information flow terms, OCC enforces a
            mandatory creation policy: authenticated state can only be generated through specific
            channels (the protected commit interface), analogous to noninterference applied to
            creation rather than observation.

            Blockchain systems enforce that state changes require consensus among distributed
            participants. The architectural parallel to OCC is real: both create structural
            bottlenecks through which state transitions must pass. However, blockchain achieves
            consensus through economic coordination among mutually distrustful parties, while OCC
            achieves origin enforcement through boundary isolation and cryptographic causality at a
            single enforcement point. OCC generalizes the structural bottleneck principle to
            arbitrary protected boundaries without requiring distributed consensus, economic
            incentives, or global coordination.

          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Bundle Protocol (RFC 9171) and DTN architecture provide store-and-forward transport
            for environments with extreme latency and intermittent connectivity. Bundle security
            (BPSec, RFC 9172) provides integrity and confidentiality at the bundle layer but does not
            constrain how authenticated payloads are created&mdash;it secures transport, not genesis.
            OCC complements DTN by enforcing that bundle payloads finalized through a protected
            commit interface carry portable verification material validatable offline against
            pre-distributed trust anchors, with no return path to the origin required. OCC proofs
            map onto BP extension blocks, enabling authenticated bundles to traverse existing DTN
            infrastructure without routing modifications.

            merely the preferred creation path; it is the only creation path for authenticated media.

          12. Instantiations of the Atomic Boundary
        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The atomic execution boundary is an architectural abstraction. Concrete implementations
          vary by platform, deployment environment, and assurance requirements. Possible
          instantiations include:
        </p>
        <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm text-text-secondary">
          <li>&#8226; <strong className="text-text">Device-level TEEs or secure enclaves</strong> gating camera output, sensor release, or local file creation.</li>
          <li>&#8226; <strong className="text-text">Kernel-mediated commit paths</strong> controlling writes to protected namespaces.</li>
          <li>&#8226; <strong className="text-text">HSM-backed services</strong> finalizing logs, media, or datasets in backend systems.</li>
          <li>&#8226; <strong className="text-text">Operating system services</strong> that mediate all protected commit paths, centralizing admission policy and proof generation.</li>
          <li>&#8226; <strong className="text-text">Gateway or pipeline enforcement</strong> at ingestion points where data enters trusted domains.</li>
          <li>&#8226; <strong className="text-text">Secure pipeline stages</strong> in CI/CD or regulated data ingestion workflows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          These mechanisms differ in construction, but the enforcement invariant is the same:
          authenticated durable state can be finalized only through a protected commit interface that
          performs boundary-fresh cryptographic binding and authorization inside an atomic execution
          boundary.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          What is required is not a particular trust anchor or hardware feature, but structural
          enforcement of finalization ordering and exclusivity. The architecture does not prescribe
          implementations&mdash;it defines the invariant that implementations must satisfy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In practical terms, the protected commit interface presents a narrow surface: the caller
          submits candidate content and policy metadata; the boundary performs hashing, binding,
          authorization, and signing internally; and the caller receives the authenticated artifact
          and its verification material (or a confirmation that verification material has been stored
          at a reference point keyed by content hash). The caller never handles signing keys, never
          observes intermediate cryptographic state, and cannot influence the boundary-fresh value.
          Whether this interface is realized as a system call, a hardware enclave entry point, an HSM
          API, or a cloud service endpoint, the enforcement properties are identical.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          OCC does not prevent the construction of unauthorized boundaries. Any party can build a
          boundary and produce verification material. However, artifacts produced by unauthorized
          boundaries fail verification under accepted trust anchors, because those boundaries&apos;
          identities are not in the approved set. Trust is mediated by trust anchor policy, not by
          preventing the existence of alternative boundaries.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In practice, layered deployment is common. A device may generate creation-time verification
          material, while a gateway enforces admission policy and rejects unauthenticated artifacts.
          Both layers implement the same enforcement principle at different points in the system.

            12.1 Enforcement Tier Semantics
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Concrete instantiations of the atomic execution boundary differ in the strength of the
            enforcement guarantee they provide. Not all boundaries are equivalent: a software
            boundary running in process memory and a hardware enclave with remote attestation both
            produce cryptographically valid verification material, but they provide fundamentally
            different assurance that the enforcement invariants actually held. This distinction must
            be made explicit in the proof structure itself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            OCC proofs carry two orthogonal attestations. The first is a{" "}
            <em>cryptographic attestation</em>: the signature and public key establish who signed and
            that the signed content was unaltered. This is machine-checkable by any party with the
            public key and is unconditionally verifiable offline. The second is an{" "}
            <em>enforcement attestation</em>: the boundary&apos;s identity measurement and optional
            platform attestation report establish <em>under what conditions</em> signing was
            permitted&mdash;whether the commit gate, key management, nonce generation, and signing
            occurred inside a verified hardware boundary or merely inside a software process. Atomic
            causality lives in the second attestation, not the first. A signature proves who signed;
            the enforcement context proves whether the creation-time constraints of OCC actually
            held.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Three enforcement tiers capture the practically relevant points in this assurance space:
          </p>

              <strong>Definition 12.1</strong> (Enforcement Tiers). Let <M c="B" /> be a boundary
              implementation. The <em>enforcement tier</em> of <M c="B" /> is a declaration of the
              structural properties of its atomic execution boundary:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm text-text-secondary">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-text">Software-only</strong> (<M c={"\\tau_{\\text{sw}}"} />).
                The commit gate, signing key, nonce source, and counter are all held in ordinary
                process memory. No hardware isolation separates them from application code. The
                signing key may be extractable by any code with sufficient privilege. Verification
                material is cryptographically valid but provides no hardware boundary guarantee.
                Suitable for development and integration testing; does not satisfy the Boundary
                Isolation invariant (Definition 4.1) against a privileged-process adversary.

              <li>
                <strong className="text-text">Hardware-bound key</strong> (<M c={"\\tau_{\\text{hw}}"} />).
                The signing key is held in a hardware security boundary (Secure Enclave, TPM, HSM)
                and is non-exportable. However, the commit gate&mdash;the logic that decides which
                candidate data is eligible for signing&mdash;runs outside the measured boundary. The
                host process feeds content digests to the hardware for signing; the hardware signs
                whatever it is asked. This provides hardware-bound identity: the signing key cannot be
                extracted, so signatures are unforgeable. But it does not provide causal enforcement:
                a compromised host can submit arbitrary digests and receive valid signatures without
                passing through the protected commit interface. The enforcement invariant holds for
                key security but not for commit-path exclusivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-text">Measured TEE</strong> (<M c={"\\tau_{\\text{tee}}"} />).
                The commit gate, key management, nonce generation, monotonic counter, and signing all
                execute inside the attested enclave boundary. The host is treated as untrusted and
                cannot influence the commit decision or observe intermediate cryptographic state. The
                enclave&apos;s identity is a hardware-measured value&mdash;a cryptographic hash of the
                enclave binary computed by the hardware boot chain&mdash;that cannot be forged by
                user-space code or produced by a different binary. A verifier who pins acceptable
                measurements to a known-good enclave image and validates the attestation report is
                guaranteed, under the hardware trust model, that the enforcement invariants held at
                genesis.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A critical subtlety distinguishes tamper-evidence from self-authentication. The
            enforcement tier is included in the signed body of every OCC proof, making it
            tamper-evident in transit: an adversary who intercepts a proof and attempts to substitute
            a higher-assurance tier will break the signature. However, the tier field is{" "}
            <em>self-reported</em> by the boundary adapter. A malicious or misconfigured adapter can
            declare any tier. The signed field prevents downgrade attacks during transmission; it
            does not prevent a lying producer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Actual trust in a declared tier therefore requires independent corroboration.
            For <M c={"\\tau_{\\text{tee}}"} />, this means: (1) pinning acceptable measurements to
            a known-good enclave image hash published by the boundary operator or auditor, and (2)
            validating a hardware attestation report&mdash;a vendor-signed document generated by the
            hardware itself, bound to the specific commit, that certifies the enclave measurement
            matches a known image. Signature verification establishes cryptographic integrity.
            Measurement pinning establishes identity. Attestation report validation establishes that
            the identity was produced by real hardware under the declared conditions. All three are
            necessary; any two leave a gap. A verifier who checks the signature and trusts the
            self-reported tier without verifying measurement and attestation has verified fact
            (A)&mdash;who signed&mdash;but not fact (B)&mdash;whether the OCC invariants actually
            held.

              mobile Secure Enclaves, TPMs, or HSMs where the signing key is hardware-protected but
              the commit gate runs in application code. Such systems provide meaningful security
              against key extraction&mdash;an adversary cannot steal the private key&mdash;but do not
              satisfy commit-path exclusivity. Application code feeding arbitrary digests to the
              hardware signer can produce valid signatures for any content without traversal of the
              protected commit interface. This is useful as an identity anchor and may be sufficient
              for some deployment contexts, but it is architecturally distinct
              from <M c={"\\tau_{\\text{tee}}"} /> and does not satisfy OCC&apos;s Atomic Causality

            where the adversary model does not include privileged process access. It is a structural
            classification that makes the adversary model explicit in the proof itself. Verifiers
            select the tier they require based on their own threat model. A local development tool
            may accept <M c={"\\tau_{\\text{sw}}"} />. A regulated ingestion gateway may
            require <M c={"\\tau_{\\text{tee}}"} /> with measurement pinning and attestation
            validation. The same proof format and verification protocol supports all three, with
            enforcement strength determined by verifier policy rather than proof format version.

          14. Implementation Considerations
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Latency.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Creation-time enforcement must be fast enough to run on capture and export paths without
          degrading user experience or pipeline throughput. Efficient proof generation and
          verification are engineering constraints, not architectural limitations. Modern signing
          operations (Ed25519, ECDSA P-256) complete in microseconds on current hardware.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Offline operation.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Environments requiring offline creation can generate proofs locally and defer admission
          into trusted domains until connectivity is available. Trusted domains then enforce
          verification at ingestion. This provides bounded issuance guarantees rather than continuous
          supervision&mdash;analogous to how physical secure instruments (e.g., pre-signed checks)
          operate with deferred clearing. In extreme cases&mdash;interplanetary missions, remote
          sensor networks, or disconnected autonomous systems&mdash;offline operation may span hours
          to days, with proofs verified only upon eventual receipt at a ground station or gateway
          operating under the same trust anchors.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Failure handling.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Systems must define failure behavior. For high-assurance domains, fail-closed behavior is
          required: if proof generation fails, finalization is blocked. For consumer deployments,
          staged enforcement may begin with fail-open at selected boundaries and evolve toward
          fail-closed as operational confidence increases.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Verification material formats and transport.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Verification material may be embedded within the artifact, carried in a sidecar file,
          included in a bundle manifest, transmitted as an authenticated envelope, or held at a
          reference point for query-based verification (see{" "}
          <a href="#sec-verification-independence" className="text-text underline decoration-border-subtle underline-offset-2">
            Section 9.5
          </a>). The key requirement is that verification material is bound to the artifact in a way
          that can be validated independently and cannot be retroactively attached without detection.
          The choice of transport mechanism is a deployment decision; the enforcement invariant is
          the same regardless of how verification material reaches the verifier.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Key rotation and revocation.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Operational deployments require key rotation policies and revocation mechanisms. When a
          boundary is compromised, trust anchors can be revoked or rotated, new boundary identities
          introduced, and epoch constraints enforced on acceptable verification material. No artifact
          registry is required for rotation or recovery.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Interoperability with provenance systems.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          OCC coexists with provenance and credentialing systems that focus on post-creation
          traceability. Provenance chains can be attached to artifacts finalized under OCC, providing
          richer downstream traceability. The admission decision remains anchored in enforced
          finalization, while provenance provides the interoperability layer for distribution and
          audit.

          15. Deployment and Adoption
        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Origin Controlled Computing is best understood as an enforcement primitive that can be
          introduced incrementally. Most environments cannot transition from fully permissive
          creation to strict admissibility in a single step.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Phased rollout.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A practical deployment begins with visibility: attaching verification material when
          available and surfacing authenticated versus unauthenticated status. The next phase
          requires authenticated finalization for selected high-assurance workflows while allowing
          unauthenticated outputs in a separate untrusted lane. Over time, enforcement expands to
          additional repositories, export paths, and regulated domains. Each phase requires
          engineering integration with existing commit paths, and the phased model is designed to
          contain this cost by limiting initial enforcement to high-value boundaries.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Policy-driven boundaries.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The decisive question in most deployments is not whether an artifact can be produced, but
          whether it can be admitted into a domain that confers legitimacy, downstream impact, or
          compliance standing. OCC can be applied selectively at these boundaries: ingestion into
          training corpora, publication to official channels, archival in compliance systems, or
          persistence into audit-grade logs.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Institutional adoption incentives.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Adoption is accelerated when benefits are concrete: reduced downstream moderation burden,
          improved auditability, clearer liability boundaries, and the ability to define and enforce
          admissible content policies. In high-volume environments, the ability to reject
          unauthenticated artifacts at ingestion is more valuable than attempting to detect or
          classify them after the fact. Organizations already subject to compliance
          mandates&mdash;regulated data processors, evidentiary systems, and entities operating under
          frameworks such as the EU AI Act&mdash;are natural early adopters, as they face the
          strongest immediate demand for structural authenticity guarantees.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">End state.</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The end state is not universal prevention of unauthenticated creation, but reliable
          exclusion of unauthenticated durable state from the systems and pipelines where legitimacy,
          compliance, and downstream impact are determined.

        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Origin Controlled Computing applies wherever systems must distinguish admissible durable
          outputs from arbitrary durable outputs produced outside trusted pipelines. The common
          architectural pattern is a protected commit path that gates admission into authenticated
          durable state. The pattern arises across domains:

          <li><strong className="text-text">Digital identity and credential issuance</strong>, where credentials must be structurally unforgeable.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-text">Supply chain verification</strong>, where provenance must be enforced at each handoff rather than reconstructed afterward.</li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-text">Authorization transfer and ledger-independent scarcity</strong>,
            where transfer of digital value or authority is enforced by a single atomic transition
            that both irreversibly de-authorizes the sender capability and generates the receiver
            capability within a protected execution boundary. This is a direct application of the
            birth&ndash;death semantics described in{" "}
            <a href="#sec-birth-death" className="text-text underline decoration-border-subtle underline-offset-2">
              Section 17
            </a>: the prior authority undergoes verifiable death, and the successor undergoes
            verifiable birth, within a single atomic event. This preserves scarcity invariants
            structurally and implies double-spend resistance without global ledgers, distributed
            consensus, or registry-based settlement infrastructure. The settlement and monetary
            implications are substantial and are explored separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-text">Interplanetary and delay-tolerant systems</strong>, where
            authentication must be non-interactive, verification must occur offline, and proofs must
            travel with data across store-and-forward networks with minutes-to-hours latency.
            OCC&apos;s non-interactive finalization, compact portable proofs, and hardware-rooted
            trust align with the operational constraints of DTN/Bundle Protocol environments, where
            real-time protocols, centralized registries, and consensus mechanisms are infeasible.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Across these domains, trust derives from enforced admission into authenticated state at
          commit time, not from retrospective provenance reconstruction. When admissibility matters,
          origin enforcement necessarily moves into the creation and finalization paths of the system.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Origin Controlled Computing (OCC) enforces what we term <em>birth&ndash;death
          semantics</em> for digital state. Under this model, every authoritative state transition
          has exactly one verifiable moment of creation (birth), and every transfer or succession
          requires cryptographic evidence that the prior authority has been irreversibly consumed
          (death).
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Traditional provenance systems operate in a <em>detect-after</em> model: artifacts are
          produced freely, and conflicts such as replay, duplication, or double-spend are identified
          retrospectively through logs, ledgers, or consensus. OCC instead constrains the execution
          path such that invalid successor states are structurally unreachable within the enforcing
          boundary.

            Within a verifier-accepted measured boundary (e.g., a Trusted Execution Environment or
            equivalent protected constructor), a valid OCC commit requires the atomic execution of
            the following steps:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm text-text-secondary">
            <li>&#8226; Policy authorization of the requested operation</li>
            <li>&#8226; Generation and atomic consumption of a fresh, non-replayable commitment value (either an unpredictable nonce or a strictly monotonic counter)</li>
            <li>&#8226; Collision-resistant binding of the artifact digest to the consumed value</li>

            No intermediate state is externally observable, and partial completion yields no valid
            proof. The consumed value establishes a forward-only lineage: any valid successor must
            reference a strictly later state within the boundary&apos;s monotonic domain.

            Birth&ndash;death semantics targets the core primitive underlying double-spend failures:
            the ability to produce multiple valid successor states from a single authority. By making
            such forks structurally unreachable at commit time within the stated trust envelope, OCC
            reduces reliance on global ordering for single-holder and provenance-sensitive workflows.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Origin Controlled Computing (OCC) enables single-transfer digital value by binding
          authority to a consumptive, cryptographically enforced state transition rather than to a
          ledger entry. This is a concrete instantiation of the birth&ndash;death semantics
          described in{" "}
          <a href="#sec-birth-death" className="text-text underline decoration-border-subtle underline-offset-2">
            Section 17
          </a>: each transfer atomically consumes (kills) the prior holder&apos;s authority and
          produces (births) a new verifiable successor. Each artifact carries a proof that can only
          be produced through a protected commit path, where authorization, binding, and durable
          commit occur atomically inside a trusted execution boundary. When value is transferred, the
          prior holder&apos;s permission is provably consumed and the new state is independently
          verifiable offline using public keys and hash lineage. The bytes themselves may be copied,
          but the authoritative right cannot be duplicated, because the single-successor property
          guarantees that only one unspent lineage can exist at a time within the enforcing boundary.
          In this model, uniqueness and transfer integrity come from enforced execution semantics
          instead of global consensus, allowing blockchain-free, verifiable digital handoff.

          19. Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Trusted Origin Token Architecture demonstrates that origin control can be enforced by
          consuming authorization units at finalization. Origin Controlled Computing generalizes
          this result by showing that equivalent enforcement is achieved using boundary-fresh
          cryptographic computation and protected commit paths, without requiring tracked tokens.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Atomic Causality links authorization, cryptographic binding, and durable commit into a
          single indivisible event. Authenticated durable state is defined by structural
          reachability&mdash;by the state transitions that produced it&mdash;not by historical
          claims, metadata, or post-hoc annotation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The formal model presented here shows that OCC defines a new enforcement primitive: a{" "}
          <em>genesis access control mechanism</em> that constrains which authenticated objects are
          permitted to exist, rather than mediating operations on objects that already exist. This is
          strictly stronger than classical reference monitors and formally distinct from attested
          execution, information flow control, and capability-based security.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          By securing creation rather than history, Origin Controlled Computing establishes an
          architectural primitive for trustworthy digital systems. It does not replace provenance,
          verification, or access control. It provides the structural foundation that makes those
          mechanisms enforceable at the boundaries where legitimacy is conferred.
