/**
 * occ-core proof hash
 *
 * Canonical, deterministic proof hash computation.
 *
 * The proof hash covers the SIGNED BODY — the fields that are
 * cryptographically signed by the enclave. This matches what the
 * Ed25519 signature covers, making the hash verifiable.
 *
 * Signed body fields:
 *   - version, artifact, commit
 *   - publicKeyB64 (from signer)
 *   - enforcement, measurement (from environment)
 *   - attribution (if present)
 *   - attestationFormat (if attestation present)
 *
 * This hash is used for:
 *   - prevB64 chain linking
 *   - S3 ledger key generation
 *   - Ethereum anchor binding
 *   - Proof deduplication and verification
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Extract signed body fields
 *   2. canonicalize(signedBody) — recursive key sort, compact JSON, UTF-8
 *   3. SHA-256 of canonical bytes
 *   4. Base64-standard encode (RFC 4648 §4)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: All call sites MUST use this function. Do NOT compute
 * proof hashes ad-hoc with JSON.stringify or Object.keys().sort().
 * Non-recursive key sorting diverges on nested objects.
