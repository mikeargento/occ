/**
 * occ-core host abstraction
 *
 * `HostCapabilities` is the sole interface between this library and any
 * Trusted Execution Environment. All TEE-specific behavior (attestation,
 * key management, monotonic counters, secure clocks) is supplied by a
 * caller-provided implementation of this interface.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *   - TEE-agnostic: no vendor types leak into this file
 *   - Fail-closed: every capability is async and may reject
 *   - Extensible: optional capabilities use the ? modifier so that
 *     adapters can be progressively enhanced without breaking the core
 *   - Self-describing: enforcementTier declares the adapter's trust class
 *
 * Adapters (e.g. aws-nitro, sgx-dcap, sev-snp) live in separate packages
 * and implement this interface. A minimal in-process stub for testing is
 * provided in @occ/stub.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — adapter authors:
 *   enforcementTier is self-reported and signed into every proof.
 *   Claiming "measured-tee" requires that ALL of the following execute
 *   inside the attested enclave boundary:
 *     - key generation and sealing
 *     - nonce generation (getFreshNonce)
 *     - monotonic counter (nextCounter)
 *     - commit gate logic
 *     - signing (sign)
 *   If any of these run outside the boundary, the correct tier is "hw-key"
 *   or "stub". Misrepresenting the tier is an architectural violation of
 *   OCC's atomic causality invariant.
